        "Code": "print('Hello, Python!')",
        "Description": "This program prints 'Hello, Python!' to the console. It demonstrates how to output text using the print function in Python."
      },
      "Exercise": {
        "Task": "Create a new Python file called 'greeting.py' and write a program that prints 'Welcome to Python programming!' to the console. Run this program from your command prompt or terminal.",
